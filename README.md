# Steem - The Blockchain That Will Tokenize The Web

Welcome to the official repository for Steem, the blockchain that will revolutionize the web, and soon the blockchain for Smart Media Tokens!



Steem is the first blockchain which introduced the "Proof of Brain" social consensus algorithm for token allocation.

Being one of the most actively developed blockchain projects currently in existence, it's become fertile soil for entrepreneurial pursuits. It has also become home for many cryptocurrency centric projects.

Steem aims to be the preferred blockchain for dApp development with Smart Media Tokens at its core. With SMTs, everyone can leverage the power of Steem.

Originally, Steem was announced on the [Bitcointalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1410943.new) prior to the start of any mining. (Steem is currently not mineable)

# Installation

Getting started with Steem is fairly simple. You can either choose to use docker-images, build with docker manually or build from source directly. All steps have been documented and while many different OS are supported, the easiest one is Ubuntu 18.04.

## Quickstart

Just want to get up and running quickly? We have pre-built Docker images for your convenience. More details are in our [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/steemit/steem/blob/master/doc/exchangequickstart.md).

## Building

We **strongly** recommend using one of our pre-built Docker images or using Docker to build Steem. Both of these processes are described in the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/steemit/steem/blob/master/doc/exchangequickstart.md).

But if you would still like to build from source, we also have [build instructions](https://github.com/steemit/steem/blob/master/doc/building.md) for Linux (Ubuntu LTS) and macOS.

## Dockerized P2P Node

To run a p2p node (ca. 2GB of memory is required at the moment):

    docker run \
        -d -p 2001:2001 -p 8090:8090 --name steemd-default \
        steemit/steem

    docker logs -f steemd-default  # follow along

## Dockerized Full Node

To run a node with *all* the data (e.g. for supporting a content website)
ca. 14GB of memory, and growing, is required:

    docker run \
        --env USE_WAY_TOO_MUCH_RAM=1 --env USE_FULL_WEB_NODE=1 \
        -d -p 2001:2001 -p 8090:8090 --name steemd-full \
        steemit/steem

    docker logs -f steemd-full

## CLI Wallet

We provide a basic cli wallet for interfacing with `steemd`. The wallet is self-documented via command line help. The node you connect to via the cli wallet needs to be running the `account_by_key_api`, `condenser_api`, and needs to be configured to accept WebSocket connections via `webserver-ws-endpoint`.

## Testing

See [doc/devs/testing.md](doc/devs/testing.md) for test build targets and info
on how to use lcov to check code test coverage.

# Configuration

## Config File

Run `steemd` once to generate a data directory and config file. The default location is `~/.steemd`. Kill `steemd`. It won't do anything without seed nodes. If you want to modify the config to your liking, we have two example configs used in the docker images. ( [consensus node](contrib/config-for-docker.ini), [full node](contrib/fullnode.config.ini) ) All options will be present in the default config file and there may be more options needing to be changed from the docker configs (some of the options actually used in images are configured via command line).

## Seed Nodes

A list of most reliable seed nodes is compiled in steemd, and can also be found in 
[doc/seednodes.txt](doc/seednodes.txt).

This same file is baked into the docker images and can be overridden by
setting `STEEMD_SEED_NODES` in the container environment at `docker run`
time to a whitespace delimited list of seed nodes (with port).


## Environment variables

There are quite a few environment variables that can be set to run steemd in different ways:

* `USE_WAY_TOO_MUCH_RAM` - if set to true, steemd starts a 'full node'
* `USE_FULL_WEB_NODE` - if set to true, a default config file will be used that enables a full set of API's and associated plugins.
* `USE_NGINX_FRONTEND` - if set to true, this will enable an NGINX reverse proxy in front of steemd that proxies WebSocket requests to steemd. This will also enable a custom healthcheck at the path '/health' that lists how many seconds away from current blockchain time your node is. It will return a '200' if it's less than 60 seconds away from being synced.
* `USE_MULTICORE_READONLY` - if set to true, this will enable steemd in multiple reader mode to take advantage of multiple cores (if available). Read requests are handled by the read-only nodes and write requests are forwarded back to the single 'writer' node automatically. NGINX load balances all requests to the reader nodes, 4 per available core. This setting is still considered experimental and may have trouble with some API calls until further development is completed.
* `HOME` - set this to the path where you want steemd to store it's data files (block log, shared memory, config file, etc). By default `/var/lib/steemd` is used and exists inside the docker container. If you want to use a different mount point (like a ramdisk, or a different drive) then you may want to set this variable to map the volume to your docker container.

## PaaS mode

Steemd now supports a PaaS mode (platform as a service) that currently works with Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk service. It can be launched using the following environment variables:

* `USE_PAAS` - if set to true, steemd will launch in a format that works with AWS EB. Containers will exit upon failure so that they can be relaunched automatically by ECS. This mode assumes `USE_WAY_TOO_MUCH_RAM` and `USE_FULL_WEB_NODE`, they do not need to be also set.
* `S3_BUCKET` - set this to the name of the S3 bucket where you will store shared memory files for steemd in Amazon S3. They will be stored compressed in bz2 format with the file name `blockchain-$VERSION-latest.tar.bz2`, where $VERSION is the release number followed by the git short commit hash stored in each docker image at `/etc/steemdversion`.
* `SYNC_TO_S3` - if set to true, the node will function to only generate shared memory files and upload them to the specified S3 bucket. This makes fast deployments and autoscaling for steemd possible.


## System Requirements

A dedicated server or virtual machine with a minimum of 64GB of RAM, and at least 350GB of fast local SSD storage. STEEM is one of the most active blockchains in the world and handles an incredibly large amount of transactions per second, as such, it requires fast storage to run efficiently.
Any modern 64-bit CPU with decent single core performance should be sufficient. Steemd is constantly growing. As of August 2019, these numbers were accurate, but you may find you need more disk space to run a full node. We are also constantly working on optimizing Steem's use of disk space.

On Linux use the following Virtual Memory configuration for the initial sync and subsequent replays. It is not needed for normal operation.

```
echo    75 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio
echo  1000 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs
echo    80 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
echo 30000 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs
```
