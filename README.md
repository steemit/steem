How to Mine
-----------

The mining algorithm used by Steem requires the owner to have access to the private key
used by the account. This means it does not favor mining pools.

    ./steemd --miner=["accountname","${WIFPRIVATEKEY}"] --witness="accountname" --seed-node="52.38.66.234:2001"

Make sure that your accountname is unique and not already used by someone else or your proof of work
might not be accepted by the blockchain.
